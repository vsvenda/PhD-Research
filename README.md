3) State estimation model reduction through the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM)
V. G. Švenda, M. K. Transtrum, B. L. Francis, A. T. Sarić and A. M. Stanković, "State Estimation Model Reduction Through the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method," in IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, vol. 37, no. 1, pp. 272-281, Jan. 2022, doi: 10.1109/TPWRS.2021.3091547.

Four test networks are provided on which simulations can be run:
1) IEEE 14 bus test system
2) IEEE 300 bus test system
3) Serbia 442 bus test system

Realistic measurement behavior is provided through code given in folder "NS2". To generate data using this code, you would need the following software: Network Simulator 2 (NS2) and PiccSIM Toolchain. Data for the IEEE 14 bus test system is already provided in "Results_14_Bus_all_RTU.win.txt" and "Results_14_Bus_all_PMU.win.txt"
